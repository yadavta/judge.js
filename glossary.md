* **Official Tabroom Name** - the full name of the tournament on Tabroom. In most cases, this official tabroom name will be significantly longer than the
* **Tournament ID** - the identifying String that is assigned to this tournament in the database. The ID should always be the *colloquial tournament name* with the *year* in which the tournament occurs appended. The ID must follow formatting for best results.
* **Start Date** - the date of the first day of the tournament.
* **End Date** - the date of the last day of the tournament. In most cases, the end date will include finals.
* **Applicable Circuits** - the circuits for which the tournament qualifies. The *local circuit* refers to tournaments within Washington state that target in-state competitors, prefer lay debate and/or offer bids to the WIAA state touramnet. The *national circuit* refers to tournaments within the United States that target out-of-state competitors, prefer circuit/progressive debate and/or offer TOC bids.
* **Formal Classifications** - these are geared towards the administrative status of the tournament. If the club has agreed to attend a tournament, that tournament is *club approved*. If the school administration and ASB have approved for the club to attend the tournament, that tournament is also *school approved*. If members of the club plan on going to the tournament as independent, not as a school, then the tournament should be marked *as independent*. Please note that if the club is attending the tournament, and one or two people also happen to be going independently, then the tournament should NOT be marked *as independent*.
* **Target Judges** - this refers to the judges that squads should be finding for the tournament. For most local tournaments, there are no real requirements regarding judges, so the *parents and volunteers* option should be marked. For most national circuit tournaments, there are stringent requirements on judges that Interlake's parents usually fail to meet; in this scenario, *hires* should be chosen. It is possible to choose both *parents and volunteers* and *hires* if appropriate.
